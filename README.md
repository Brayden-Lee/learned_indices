## Autoindex is a C++ implementation of a learned index structure.

This is based on the B-Tree section of [The Case for Learned Index Structures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01208.pdf) paper, and depends on [nn_cpp](https://github.com/bcaine/nn_cpp), which is a minimalistic Eigen based neural network library.

### Dependencies

- [nn_cpp](https://github.com/bcaine/nn_cpp) - Eigen based minimalistic C++ Neural Network library
- [cpp-btree](https://code.google.com/archive/p/cpp-btree/) - A fast C++ implementation of a B+ Tree
