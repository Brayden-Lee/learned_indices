## Autoindex is a C++ implementation of a learned index structure.

This is based on the B-Tree section of [The Case for Learned Index Structures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01208.pdf) paper, and depends on [nn_cpp](https://github.com/bcaine/nn_cpp), which is a minimalistic Eigen based neural network library.

### Dependencies

- [nn_cpp](https://github.com/bcaine/nn_cpp) - Eigen based minimalistic C++ Neural Network library
- [STX B+ Tree](https://panthema.net/2007/stx-btree/) - A fast C++ implementation of a B+ Tree (can be installed on Ubuntu 16.04 as sudo apt-get install stx-btree-dev)
